# What is Data Structures?
> A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.


 ## 1- Linked List
 A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node. For example,

 ### Linked List Types:
 
  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
  * Circular Doubly Linked List
 
 ### Linked List Applications:
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Implemented in stack and queue
* In undo functionality of softwares
* Hash tables, Graphs

## 2- Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

### Applications of Stack

- To reverse a word
- In compilers
- In browsers


## 3- Queue
A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.
Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

### Types Of Queue: 
- Simple Queue
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue

 -Double Ended Queue
 ### Applications of Queue
 - CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling
 - IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc
 - Handling of interrupts in real-time systems.
 - Call Center phone systems use Queues to hold people calling them in order.
 
## 4- Hash Table
The Hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs where

*Key:  unique integer that is used for indexing the values.*

*Value- data that are associated with keys.*

### Hash Tables Types:
  * Linear Probing
  * Quadratic Probing
  * Double Hashing
  * Chaining Seperate
  
  ### Applications of Hash Table
- Constant time lookup and insertion is required
- Cryptographic applications
- Indexing data is required
  
## 5- Tree
### Trees Types
  * Binary Tree
  * Binary Search Tree (BST)
  * AVL Tree
  * B-Tree
## 6- Graph

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.For Example, on facebook, everything is a node. That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note...anything that has data is a node.
